0.  An atrificial long word to signify a disease of lung.
1.  getrusage returns resource usage measures.
2.  Struct rusage has 16 members.
3.  Before and after are passed by reference to save time because we would otherwise would have to copy those 2 structs, wasting resources in the process.
4.  The main function's for loop loops over the file, getting every character till the condition for EOF is reached.
    Every time we are in a loop it check is the character it just read is an alphabet, or it checks if it is an apostrofe succeeding a char. 
    Then this char or apostrofe appended to the word and int index is increased. INT index signifies growing size of the word. 
    There is a condition in place to check if the index does not cross the maximum length of a word possible. If the word in question crosses this threshold,
    the program skips over all the chars untill a alphabet is reched.
    We check if the apostrofe is preceded by char by an int; index. Further if the char is not a and is a integer, 
    the program skips the remaining chars of this word untill a char is reached that is not alphanumeric and it is further not EOF.
    Now when we have index > 0 any char that comes which is not alphabetic or apostrofe should imply end of that perticual word, 
    thus resetting the index to 0.
5.  It reads each and every character and can find out easily and efficiently if a word is a word or number or puntuation. It also helps in
    saving resources as we need to save less chars untill we find if the word is a word or some random cnon alphabetical characters.
6.  We have passed const parameters to check and laod for helping us program them correctly, throwing us errors if we try to modify the parameters passed in.
